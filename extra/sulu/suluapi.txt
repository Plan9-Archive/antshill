# Guide to using mrsulu.rc

whatsit.rc dfour
whatsit.rc dfour rocks.sim
commands as defined in rocks.sim.fns

A .sim file needs to provide these four fns:

siminit
updatestate
msgproc
tickstate

siminit is called once at the beginning of the sim. it must set up the variables $state and $sendout. The only var defined is $mynum, the binary hypercube node id. setting $simend (the tick the program will exit) and $simlimit (the tick beyond which the simulation will not change) is optional.

updatestate is called every tick. its purpose is to initialize variable names from the contents of the $state list.

msgproc is called if there is a message with positive sign at this time tick. it should initialize its local vars from the $body list of the received message. Interactions with $body should be contained to this function.

tickstate is called to finalize state before messages are sent and state is saved for this virtual time tick. It needs to prepare the $state and $sendout vars for commitment and transmission.

The simulation object process may examine, but not modify, the $cvt and other variables in the environment. Other than private local state, only the $state and $sendout variables are permissible to modify.

a sample implementation of a very simple sim is ping.sim, with a template of control functions set up for 4d in ping.sim.fns. ping.sim can be run any # of dimensions, just change the number of ???? in the .fns file to make the control functions match.
