## N-cubic algorithms

This post continues our exploration of hypercubic computing, as used by the nCUBE series of 80s and 90s supercomputers. The previous post explained the basic structure of the binary hypercube, its origins and use in computing, and showed hypercubic routing running on the spawngrid. This post will look more deeply at hypercubic, and show how algorithms for parallel computing can leverage the structure of the n-cube.

### Hypercube full exchange template

This is the most generally useful hypercube algorithm template. It accomplishes the task of exchanging information between all nodes of an ncube in n steps. In other words, if we have 16 nodes in a 4cube, it takes 4 processing steps to transmit informatiion such that each node has access to the information present on all nodes. At each stage in the transmission process, a transformation can be performed. The following example simply accumulates the state.

	while(! ~ `{date -n} *0?)sleep .5
	echo $mynum `{date} >/tmp/cout.$mynum
	dim=`{echo -n $mynum |wc -c}
	input=`{cat /tmp/cin.$mynum}
	out=$input
	i=0
	while(! ~ $i $dim){
		echo $out >>/n/cube/$i
		newin=`{read}
		out=($newin $out)
		echo $out >>/tmp/cout.$mynum
		i=`{echo $i + 1 |hoc}
		sleep 1
		while(! ~ `{date -n} *[05])sleep .1
	}

This is a very beautiful algorithm in my opinion. It loops once for each dimension of the cube, and at each step neighbors exchange information along the dimensional axis corresponding to the loop counter. The algorithm begins with a possibly unique chunk of data present at each node, and concludes with each node having an identical copy of the fully processed dataset.

### Hypercube logarithmic broadcast

This is the algorithm to fanout data from a given point on the cube, easily specified as the all-0 origin. It takes n steps to distribute data from a single node to all nodes of the cube. The initial boilerplate is identical to the above, with the loop body being:

	while(! ~ $i $dim){
		theirid=`{hyper -id $i -f $mynum}
		theirdec=`{echo 'obase=10; ibase=2; print '$theirid | bc}
		if(test $theirdec -gt $mydec){
			echo $out >>/n/cube/$i
			echo $out >>/tmp/cout.$mynum
		}
		if not{
			msg=`{read}
			out=($msg)
		}
		i=`{echo $i + 1 |hoc}
		sleep 1
		while(! ~ `{date -n} *[05])sleep .1
	}
	echo $out >>/tmp/cout.$mynum

The idea here is that at each timestep, the neighbors compare their ID numbers to see who has the larger number. That corresponds to being more hops away from the initiating 0 node, so the higher-numbered node receives a message. On each subsequent tick of the clock, a node that has previously received the data will be paired with a node with higher id, so the data is distributed in a powers-of-two fan out.

### Hypercube dimensional collapse

I don't think that name is commonly used, but it sounds cool and describes this algorithm well. It is the mirror image of the fan out algorithm, and is used to coalsece data to a single node, often with processing along the way. To show a simple example of actual hypercubic processing, I will use this algorithm as presented by nCUBE in their 1986 article on their machine. It computes the sum of squares of the elements of a vector of integers distributed among the nodes of the hypercube. This code includes the boilerplate setup section and is commented for clarity.

	#!/bin/rc
	# hypercubic sum of vectors ala nCUBE 1986
	
	# we need a decimal id for numeric comparisons
	mydec=`{echo 'obase=10; ibase=2; print '$mynum | bc}
	
	# we are using a very hacky clock-based step sync, we wait for a shared go moment
	while(! ~ `{date -n} *0?)sleep .5
	
	# initialize output file with id and timestamp
	echo $mynum `{date} >/tmp/cout.$mynum
	
	# set up dimension-1 as loop counter
	dim=`{echo -n $mynum |wc -c}
	echo $dim
	
	# get starting list of numbers aka our segment of the vector
	input=`{cat /tmp/cin.$mynum}
	# square the elements and sum them
	out=0
	for(i in $input)
		out=`{echo $out + ($i '*' $i) |hoc}
	
	# we run this loop for every dimensional connection in sequence
	i=0
	while(! ~ $i $dim){
		echo $i $out
	# find the id of our neighbor on the current port and convert to decimal
		theirid=`{hyper -id $i -f $mynum}
		theirdec=`{echo 'obase=10; ibase=2; print '$theirid | bc}
	# the cube collapses toward 0 origin so nodes with higher id send to lower
		if(test $theirdec -lt $mydec){
			echo sending $out to $theirid on $i
			echo $out >>/n/cube/$i
			echo $out >>/tmp/cout.$mynum
		}
	# if we are a reader node we wait for a message and add it to our running sum
		if not{
			echo waiting for msg...
			msg=`{read}
			out=`{echo $out + $msg |hoc}
			echo sum is $out after adding $msg
		}
		i=`{echo $i + 1 |hoc}
	# we are using unix epoch second counts ending in 0 and 5 as our timing ticks
		sleep 1
		while(! ~ `{date -n} *[05])sleep .1
	}
	
	# save final state as output after completing loop
	echo $out >>/tmp/cout.$mynum

I love visualizing the operation of this algorithm in my mind. Imagining the hypercube 'shutting itself up' by telescope-closing through successive dimensions is a fun challenge in higher-dimensional visualization.

### Code

All code in this blog post can be found in the "extra/hypercubic" subdirectory of the [main ANTS repo](https://bitbucket.org/mycroftiv/antshill) although it is likely to have evolved beyond what is present in this blog post. I am planning to update this blog post with additional research and I would appreciate any corrections or suggestions. I am interested in correspondence on these matters at mycroftiv AT sphericalharmony.com.
