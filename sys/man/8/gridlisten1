.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gridlisten1
has the same basic functionality as
.IR listen1 (8)
but also announces to an inferno registry service mounted at
.B /mnt/registry
.PP
The registry service must be mounted previously for the announcement to succeed. The basic parameters and command syntax from
.I listen1(8)
also apply. It should be noted that unless the
.I -t
flag is used, the registry will need to be mounted by the
.B /lib/namespace
file on the system, because the change to user none rebuilds the namespace and the mount of the registry will be lost. The use of 
.I -t
eliminates the need for this but does mean the listener is run as the invoking user.
.SH EXAMPLES
