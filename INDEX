INSTALLING README INDEX GUIDE - intro documentation and help

build - script to build all components of the namespace toolkit

bootdir.extras/ - central point for main rootless boot tools

	bootpaq - this is compiled into the kernel and contains tools
	from root/lib/_mkpaq

	factotum grio hub hubfs hubshell rc rcmain - programs compiled
	into boot

	namespace namespace.saveterm namespace.standard - customized
	namespace files adapted to the rootless environment

	plan9rc - the main namespace launcher script which controls
	boot and launching additional namespaces

	ramskel - sets up the ramfs skeleton and optional tgzfs

	initskel - acts as a mini-cpurc for the rootless environment
	and its network services

	save9cfg - script to save variables used in plan9.ini and by
	plan9rc and initskel

	skel.tar - this is the tar of the bootdir.extras/root
	subdirectory

	root/ - this is what becomes the skeleton ramfs used in the
	early boot environment.  it contains mostly empty directories
	and a /usr/bootes template user directory.

cfg/ - contains configuration files and utility scripts, as well as
the toolcopy script which can be used to customize the
contents of the early boot namespace

compiletemp/ - used by the build script to compile things in

diffs/ - these files show the diffs between the modified ANTS files
and the base 9front distribution

doc/ - documentation for bootup, namespace scripts, fossil/venti
tools, plan9.ini/plan9rc/initskel variables

	ants.ps - please page ants.ps to read the full Giant ANTS
	paper

	examples/ - contains saved output of tests and demonstrations

	modified.manpages/ - modified documentation for boot (8) and
	proc (3)

	textdoc/ - older plaintext forms of documentation prior to
	manpage writing

extra/ - supporting utilities for ants-related projects

	hypercubic/ - hypercubic timewarp simulation framework in rc

	pubgrid/ - scripts used to start services on the 9gridchan.org public grid

frontmods/ - modified 9front code to be bound over base versions

grid/ - scripts used for the Spawngrid, a global network of ants servers
	providing independent namespaces from replicated venti/fossil rootscores

grio/ - modified rio with hubfs integration and other features

hubfs/ - a 'screen' replacement as a 9p fs, also general purpose
	network transparent pipe muxing for grids

patched/ - contains miscellaneous patched utilities, most of which
	are not part of base ANTS install

root/ - used to build the tools.tgz.  It contains additional chunks of
information used to provide a slightly richer plan 9 environment.

scripts/ - contains the non-bootup related namespace manipulation and
fossil/venti maintenance scripts.

AFTER COMPILING:

9ants - 9front kernel. install in 9fat partition

tools.tgz - optional support utilities. Place in 9fat
